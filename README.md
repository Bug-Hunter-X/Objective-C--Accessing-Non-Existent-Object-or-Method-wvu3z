This repository demonstrates a common, yet often tricky, error in Objective-C programming: attempting to interact with an object or method that does not exist. This typically manifests as an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error at runtime.  The example code shows how this occurs, and the solution provides the correct way to handle object initialization and method access to prevent this issue.  This issue is subtle, because it often appears in seemingly correct code, making it a common source of frustration for Objective-C developers.
